This repository contains `R` scripts to extract data and replicate Conditional Random Fields analyses used in Clark *et al* (IN PRESS in *Nature Climate Change*)  
  
**Workflow**  
The workflow to extract primary data and complete analyses is as follows:  
  
1. Download open-source data on coastal Mediterranean fish species occurrences, functional traits and phylogenetic relationships, as well as historical and projected Sea Surface Temperature data from the [FishMed](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/203/) database (Albouy et al. 2015). Note that these data are licensed and cannot be stored in this repository. However, `R` functions in the `Functions` directory are available to download the data into your working environment. Please follow steps in `Workflow/Appendix_S1_Datacollation.pdf` to extract the data  
  
2. Run Conditional Random Fields models using functions available in the `MRFcov` package (Clark et al., 2018) to analyse the binary presence-absence data downloaded in Step 1 above. While `R` code in `Workflow/Appendix_S2_Models.pdf` is available to replicate this step, note that a previous version of `MRFcov` was used and so some of the argument names may have changed but most steps should still work. Alos please note that these functions were originally run on a high-performance computing cluster using 24 processing cores to speed up computations. The models will take several hours or more to complete even on a powerful machine. We have provided the original results to save processing time. These are available in `Results/MRF.results.rda` and can be loaded directly into `R` using the `load()` command.  
  
3. Process the models to analyse their results and generate summary figures as shown in the original manuscript. The steps are outlined in `Workflow/Appendix_S3_ModelProcessing.pdf`. Most of these steps should be achievable even on personal laptops, apart from the fitting of the multivariate boosted regression trees (which rely on the `mvtboost` package, see below for instructions for downloading). This step is not partciularly slow but is very memory-heavy because each set of `500` regression trees is saved for each of the `215` fish species in order to find predictors that minimise joint prediction error. We have provided the original results of this step to save processing time. These are available in the `Results/mvtb.results.rda` and can be loaded directly into `R` using the `load()` command.
