This repository contains `R` scripts to extract data and replicate
analyses in Clark *et al* (IN PRESS in *Nature Climate Change*)

The workflow to extract data and complete analyses is as follows:

1.  Download open-source data on coastal Mediterranean fish species
    occurrences, functional traits and phylogenetic relationships, as
    well as historical and projected Sea Surface Temperature data from
    the [FishMed](http://www.esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/203/)
    database (Albouy et al.Â 2015). Note that these data are licensed and
    cannot be stored in this repository. However, `R` functions in the
    `Functions` directory are available to download the data into your
    working environment. Please follow steps in
    `Workflow/Appendix_S1_Datacollation.pdf` to extract the data

2.  Run Conditional Random Fields models using functions available in
    the `MRFcov` package (Clark et al., 2018) to analyse the binary
    presence-absence data downloaded in Step 1 above. While `R` code in
    `Workflow/Appendix_S2_Models.pdf` is available to replicate this
    step, please note that these functions were originally run on a
    high-performance computing cluster using 24 processing cores to
    speed up computations. The models will take several hours or more to
    complete even on a powerful machine. We have provided the original
    results to save processing time. These are available in
    `Results/MRF.results.rda` and can be loaded directly into `R` using
    the `load()` command.

3.  Process the models to analyse their results and generate summary
    figures as shown in the original manuscript. The steps are outlined
    in `Workflow/Appendix_S3_ModelProcessing.pdf`. Most of these steps
    should be achievable even on personal laptops, apart from the
    fitting of the multivariate boosted regression trees (which rely on
    the `mvtboost` package, see below for instructions for downloading).
    This step is not partciularly slow but is very memory-heavy because
    each set of `500` regression trees is saved for each of the `215`
    fish species in order to find predictors that minimise joint
    prediction error. We have provided the original results of this step
    to save processing time. These are available in the
    `Results/mvtb.results.rda` and can be loaded directly into `R` using
    the `load()` command.
